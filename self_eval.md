# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
*I feel very comfortable with comparison operators and feel fluent using them.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
*I feel very comfortable with logical operators and feel fluent using them.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
*These will take me some more practice to get the execution flow down. The if statements make sense to me but processing which ones to use first for the most efficient flow.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
*I spent about 4-5 hours on this assignment which DID NOT line up with time estimates at all (I set aside an hour or so), which put me waaaaay behind. I did not see all of the subsets of exercises in the comparisons, decision making etc files so I really underestimated how much time it was going to take.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
*I need to practice the if statement's and setting them up for the most efficient execution flow.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
*I had most of my questions answered on our slack channel while doing the exercises.
*The only one I still have is there was an instance in which I used "and" instead of && in a condition branch and got different outputs for each one (the and result was wrong, but && was correct). I will google to see if I can figure out why that may have happened, if not I will ask in our slack channel.
